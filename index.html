            MEASURING CRIME 
        </h1>

        <p>
            In the U.S., experts typically use one of three well-known criminal justice reporting systems 
            to measure crime, assess crime rates, and make policy decisions about public safety. The first 
            is the Uniform Crime Reports, or UCR, which is a city, county, state, and Federal law enforcement 
            program that has been in operation since 1929. This report contains nationwide crime statistics 
            compiled by the FBI from law enforcement agencies throughout the country.
